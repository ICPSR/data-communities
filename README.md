# data-communities

The code in this repository is used to analyze a citation network of ICPSR datasets cited in academic literature. The data analyzed is derived from the [ICPSR Bibliography of Data-Related Literature](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/ICPSR/citations/) citations. This analysis supports the paper [Subdivisions and Crossroads: Identifying Hidden Community Structures in a Data Archiveâ€™s Citation Network](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2205.08395). Data are archived on [openICPSR](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/174361/version/V1/view).
